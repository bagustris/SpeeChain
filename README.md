## Unique Characteristics
### Various data loading services
We provide various data loading services that enable users to easily conduct experiments across different datasets: 
1. **Customized combinations of training, validation, and testing datasets**.
The datasets used for model training, validation, and testing can be easily changed by your configuration. 
They don't have to come from the same data source.
By this, some advanced experiments can be easily conducted, such as semi-supervised learning, multimodal learning, and domain adaptation.
2. **Multiple dataloaders can be initialized for training your model.** 
Data samples from multiple datasets can be included in a single batch for training your models.
These dataloaders are independent of each other, so they may have specific datasets and batch generation strategies.
3. **Multiple datasets can be mixed up in a single dataloader.** 
The dataloader uniformly fetches data-label pairs from the mixed dataset.
4. **Data selection can be done in the dataset of each dataloader.** Sometimes we may only want to use a part of the dataset to train our models. 
With data selection, we can be freed from the annoying work of segmenting and dumping partial datasets. 
Off-the-shelf selection methods include: 
    1. random selection
    2. selection from the beginning or the end
    3. selection by metadata

### Various pseudo-labeling services
For the research on semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation, technical work about processing unlabeled data is inevitable 
(e.g. hypothesis transcripts for untranscribed speech or synthetic utterances for unspoken text).
We provide various pseudo-labeling services for unlabeled data to help researchers save more energy for their research:
1. **GPU-aid batch-level pseudo data generation.** 
As a necessary part of semi-supervised ASR and TTS models, pseudo data generation often consumes plenty of time for large-scale datasets (such as _LibriSpeech_ or _GigaSpeech_). 
The faster we get pseudo data, the more experiments we can conduct to test our ideas. 
In our toolkit, this job can be done at the batch level with the aid of multi-GPUs.
2. **Off-the-shelf correction functions for pseudo labels.** 
Pseudo-labeled data usually need to go through some corrections before being used to train our models. 
We provide some off-the-shelf correction functions to free our users from these annoying dirty jobs:
    1. Pseudo text correction:
        1. language model hypothesis reweighting
        2. inference early-stopping prevention
        3. endless inference detection
        4. n-gram looping phrase detection
        5. lexicon calibration
    2. Pseudo speech correction:
        1. silence removal
        2. non-speech sound removal
        3. synthesized artifact removal

### Highly-modularized models
The models in our toolkit are built with multiple independent modules. Independence offers the following merits:
1. **Simple model construction.** Users can easily build their models by assembling different modules like playing with LEGO bricks. 
Since our toolkit supports dynamic class importing, model construction can be easily done merely by the model configuration file.
2. **Flexible pretrained model loading.** Multiple pretrained models can be used to initialize different modules of your models. 
Also, the mismatch between the parameter names of pretrained models and your models can be easily solved by the configuration.
3. **Flexible parameters freezing.** The parameter freezing can also be done independently for each module of your models. 
The freezing granularity can be very fine (even to a specific neural layer) if you give the proper configuration.

üëÜ[Back to the table of contents]()

### Various optimization services
We provide various optimization services that offer users the possibilities for more advanced model training schemes:
1. **Multi-losses training with multiple optimizers.** Multiple optimizers can be used to train your models. 
Each optimizer has specific target losses, target model parameters, learning rate scheduling strategy, and optimization interval. 
2. **Gradient accumulation for large-batch training by limited computing resources.** 
Our toolkit enables users to accumulate the gradients from multiple small batches to mimic the one calculated by a large batch. 
The parameter optimization can be done after several steps of gradient accumulation. 
It becomes possible for you to enjoy training the large models even though you are suffering from the lack of GPUs! 
3. **Simple finetuing setting.** In our toolkit, the learning rates can be easily scaled down without changing the scheduling hyperparameters. 
The troublesome jobs of making a new LR scheduler configuration have gone!

### User-friendly documents and interfaces
We provide many interfaces for users to customize their experiment pipelines. 
Most of the interfaces return a *Dict* where users can freely design the contents of the returned results.

We also provide sufficient documents to explain the details of our toolkit. 
Please refer to the [Documentation]() section for more details.

## Toolkit Architecture
The architecture of this toolkit is shown in the figure below. Dashed lines indicate the holding relationship.

![image](architecture.png)
Our toolkit can be divided into 4 parts: **user interaction part** (green), **data loading part** (blue), **model calculation part** (red), **parameter optimization part** (brown).

üëÜ[Back to the table of contents]()

### User Interaction Part
This part interacts with the user and disk. There are three members in this part: _Runner_, _Monitor_, and _Snapshooter_. 
* **Runner** is the entry of this toolkit where the research pipeline starts. 
It encapsulates the overall procedure of training a deep learning model, shows the logging information during training, and saves the experimental results to the disk after training. 
_Runner_ holds the connections with all other members in the toolkit.

* **Monitor** encapsulates the logic of monitoring the training process, such as information logging, best model recording, early stopping checking, and so on. 
It determines what kinds of logs _Runner_ shows to users and when _Runner_ stops the training. 
Also, it keeps the connection with several _Snapshooter_ members and constantly sends snapshotting materials for them to capture the intermediate performance.

* **Snapshooter** does the job of model snapshotting. It doesn't runs in the main process of model training but another process. 
 It communicates with _Monitor_ by _multiprocessing.Process_ and _multiprocessing.Event_.

üëÜ[Back to the table of contents]()

### [Data Loading Part]()
This part plays the role of fetching raw data from the disk and processing them into usable formats for the model.
* **Dataset** stores the physical addresses of the training samples used to train your models. 
It encapsulates the logic of loading the chosen sample from the disk and preprocessing it into a trainable vector. 

* **Iterator** holds a _Dataset_ and produces a _Dataloader_ in each epoch that provide the built-in _Dataset_ with the sample indices and packages the trainable vectors into a batch.

üëÜ[Back to the table of contents]()

### [Model Calculation Part]()
This part receives the batch from the data loading part and outputs the training losses and evaluation metrics.
* **Module** is the building block of the models. The model forward process is done by a series of module sub-forward. 
Users can create their personal modules by overriding the initialization and forward interfaces.

* **Criterion**: There are two types of criteria: loss functions used for training and evaluation metrics used for validation. 
The criterion and module are independent of each other, which allows any combinations of models and criteria.
Users can create their personal criteria by overriding its initialization and forward interfaces.

* **Model** encapsulates the general model services of model initialization, pretrained parameter loading, and parameter freezing.
It holds several _Module_ members as the main body of the model to do the job of model forward and several _Criterion_ members for evaluating the model predictions.

üëÜ[Back to the table of contents]()

### [Parameter Optimization Part]()
This part does the job of updating the model parameters by the received losses. 
Unlike the traditional scheme of creating two separate objects (optimizer and scheduler), 
parameter optimization and learning rate scheduling are simultaneously done by _OptimScheduler_ in this toolkit.
* **OptimScheduler** encapsulates the logic of parameter optimization and scheduling learning rates. 
It holds a `torch.optim.Optimizer` member and provides interfaces for users to determine their personal strategies to schedule the learning rates during training.

### Development Specifications
We have some specifications for you to standardize your contribution:

1. **Documentation**: We will appreciate it a lot if you could provide enough documents for your contribution. 
    * Please give a header string at the top of the code file you made in the following format to notify others of your contribution:
        ```
            Author: Heli Qi
            Affiliation: NAIST (abbreviation is OK)
            Date: 2022.08 (yyyy.mm is enough)
        ```
    * We recommend you to use the Google-style function docstring. 
    If you are using PyCharm, you can set the docstring style in File‚ÜíSetting‚ÜíTools‚ÜíPython Integrated Tools‚ÜíDocstrings‚ÜíDocstring format.
    
        As for argument explanation in the docstring, we recommend you to write the argument type after the colon and give its description below with a tab retract as follows.
        ```
            Args:
                d_model: int
                    The dimension of the input feature sequences.
        ```
        If the argument type is `torch.Tensor` or `numpy.array`, please replace the type with its shape as follows.
        ```
            Args:
                emb_feat: (batch_size, seq_len, d_model)
                    Embedded input feature sequences
        ```
    * For in-line comments, we recommend you start a new line every time you want to comment (it's better not to type a long comment after the code). 
    The codes are better to be divided into several code blocks by their roles with an in-line comment right above the block as follows.
      ```
        # para recording
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.num_layers = num_layers
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.layernorm_first = layernorm_first
      ```
    
2. **Naming**: We have several recommendations for class names and variable names.
    * For class names, we recommend you to name your class in the CamelCase style. The names are better to be in the form of "What is it made up of" + "What is it". 
    
        For example, `SpeechTextDataset` means a dataset class that returns speech-text paired data during training. 
        `Conv2dPrenet` means a prenet module that is made up of Conv2d layers.
    * For variable names, we recommend that the name length is better to be no more than 20 characters and the name contains no more than 3 underlines *inside* it. 
    Otherwise, it will be very hard for us to understand the meanings of your variables.
    
        If the names are longer than 20 characters, please make some abbreviations. For the abbreviations, we recommend the following 2 frequently-used strategies:
        * **Tail-Truncating**: delete the letters from the tail and only retain the part before the second vowel. 
        For example, '*convolution*' -> '*conv*', '*previous*' -> '*prev*'.
        * **Vowel-Omitting**: directly delete all vowels and some trivial consonants behind each vowel. 
        For example, '*transformer*' -> '*trfm*', '*source*' -> '*src*', '*target*' -> '*tgt*'.
    * For the temporary variables only used to register data for a short period, please add an underline at the beginning of the name to notify other users.
    For example, '*_tmp_feat_dim*' means the temporary variable used to register the intermediate value of the feature dimension.
